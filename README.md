# M4A-Group-Assessment
I was the team lead for a group project, along with Kimberly Tam and Boburjon Azimov, where we created a full stack web app that was a public record of superhero/villain sightings using Spring boot, with MySQL and Jupiter testing on the backend in an MVC pattern, with ThymeLeaf, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Maps Static and Embed APIâ€™s on the front end.
